#C jam (p3)  Found by Achim Flammenkamp in 1988, but not widely known
#C    about until its independent discovery (and naming) by Dean Hickerson
#C    in September 1989.  Compare with mold.  In fact this is really very
#C    like caterer.  In terms of its 7x7 bounding box it ties with
#C    trice tongs as the smallest p3 oscillator.
