Conway's Game of Life oscillator 1-of-each collection

The purpose of this collection is to exhibit one oscillator of every
period that is known, up to 62. All larger periods can be constructed
by herschel loops similar to the p61 and p62 oscillators.

I'm not trying to find the "best" or smallest oscillator of each period,
but if you know of an oscillator that is a lot smaller or makes a much
better example than the one I have, and you have nothing better to do,
let me know about it.
