Basic glider guns in Conway's Game of Life

This collection contains at least one glider gun of every period for which 
a "true period" gun is known, up to period 62. A "true period" gun is a 
gun that fires exactly one glider per period.

Selected guns with higher periods are also included, but only if they use 
a different mechanism, and are not excessively large.

Only a few true period guns are known with a period less than 62, but 
*every* period over 62 can be constructed using mechanisms similar to 
those in g062.
