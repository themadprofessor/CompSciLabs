# Dynamic Programming

Please complete the following 4 programs (filename, difficulty, time estimate):
1. Fibonacci.java, easy, 0.5h
2. RevisionSchedule.java, easy with hints, 1h
3. ChangeMaking.java, moderate, 1h
4. GoogleWordBreak.java, hard, 2h

This exercise is not assessed.

The final task might be difficult and take significantly more time than expected if you get stuck. It might be a good idea to finish tasks 1, 2, and 3 before your scheduled lab and spend your scheduled lab on task 4 asking your tutor when you get stuck.

There is light testing included but please think about the correctness of your solution as you work on it and do your own manual or programmatic testing. Passing all test cases doesn't prove the correctness of you program!
