    \subsection*{Soudness of SpotBugs}
    SpotBugs is an unsound tool.
    For example, it failed to register the variable 'start' on line 22 is never used.
    Also, it failed to notice the BufferedReader 'reader' is not closed in a finally block, so the BufferedReader wouldn't be closed if the read call threw an exception.
    The if statement on line 35 should have raised a bug as the variables 'swap' and 1 should be compared directly as ints rather than converted into Strings.

    \subsection*{Precisness of SpotBugs}
    SpotBugs is a precise tool as there are no false positives raised by the tool.
