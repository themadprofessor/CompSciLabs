    \subsection*{Soudness of SpotBugs}
    SpotBugs is an unsound tool.
    For example, it failed to register the variable 'start' on line 22 is never used.
    Also, it failed to notice the BufferedReader 'reader' is not closed in a finally block, so the BufferedReader wouldn't be closed if the read call threw an exception.
    The if statement on line 35 should have raised a bug as the variables 'swap' and 1 should be compared directly as ints rather than converted into Strings.

    \subsection*{Precisness of SpotBugs}
    SpotBugs is an imprecise tool as it raises a bug report for not checking the return value from BufferedReader's 'read' call.
    This is not a bug as the call throws an IOException if anything noteworthy occurs.
    It returns -1 when the underlying stream is finished or the number of characters read by the call.
    BufferedReader will repeatedly read from the underlying stream until the given buffer is full so checking for the number of characters read is not needed.
