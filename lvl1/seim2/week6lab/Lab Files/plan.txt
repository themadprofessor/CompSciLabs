1. Load account information from file
2. Repeatedly get an account number, PIN and option, and process option.
3. Dump updated account information to file.

Refinement of 2:

For each account number:
    If the account exists:
        2.1 Get the PIN
        If the PIN is correct:
            2.2 Display options
            2.3 Get option
            2.4 Process option
        Else:
            2.5 Report incorrect PIN
    Else:
        2.6 Report invalid account number

There is much more refinement to be done...
