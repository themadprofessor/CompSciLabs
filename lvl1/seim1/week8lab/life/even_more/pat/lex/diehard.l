#C diehard  Any pattern that vanishes, but only after a long time.  The
#C    following example vanishes in 130 generations, which is probably the
#C    limit for patterns of 7 or fewer cells.  Note that there is no limit
#C    for higher numbers of cells - e.g., for 8 cells we could have a
#C    glider heading towards an arbitrarily distant blinker.
