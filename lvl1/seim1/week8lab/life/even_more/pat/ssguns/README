For the three standard orthogonal spaceships, the smallest known
guns (measuring area of bounding box) are currently:

LWSS:  p184 (box 38x49 = 1862)
  By SAS, using DJB's p184 glider gun and RWG's p46 twin bees
  oscillator.  The glider-to-LWSS reaction was found by RWG, and the
  stabilization of the other end by a hat is HK's improvement of NDE's
  stabilization with bookends.

MWSS:  p44  (box 44x50 = 2200)
  Minor improvement by SAS (squashing of eater2) of DL's MWSS gun
  based on PBC's improvement of DJB's single-engine p44 glider gun.
  The engine was itself found by DJB, and is stabilized by emulators
  found by RTW.

HWSS:  p184 (box 39x58 = 2262)
  Minor improvement by DL (use of clocks instead of eaters) of SAS's
  HWSS gun using DJB's p184 glider gun and RWG's p46 twin bees
  oscillator (in a stabilization found by SAS, based on an earlier
  one by NDE) together with a p8 pi-to-HWSS converter (original by
  DJB, improved by RWG).
