This is Jason's collection of patterns for Conway's Game of Life. This is
essentially a supplemental collection; it deliberately excludes most
patterns that are available elsewhere.

Some other Life pattern collections are listed on this web page:
http://pobox.com/~jason1/life/links.html#patterns

The files contained in this archive are in a format called "RLE", which is 
widely used for Life patterns. Most recent Life programs should recognize it.
