This is a collection of the smallest known Life spaceships of various
types.  Unless otherwise stated (files short.rle, thin.rle, p2-21x21.rle and
p3-15x15.rle), size is measured in terms of the minimum population, simply
because this is conventional.

Descriptions of the supplied rle files are given in the file "ships.txt".

Please report any errors or omissions to me.
