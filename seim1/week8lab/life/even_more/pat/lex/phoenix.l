#C phoenix  Any pattern all of whose cells die in every generation,
#C    but which never dies as a whole.  A spaceship cannot be a phoenix,
#C    and in fact every phoenix eventually evolves into an oscillator.
#C    The following 12-cell oscillator (found by the MIT group in December
#C    1971) is the smallest known phoenix, and is sometimes simply called
#C    "the phoenix".
